Hi, I'M Ravitheja Reddy Avala. I'm a B.Tech graduate in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, 

and I'M currently looking for opportunities in DevOps and Cloud roles.

I have hands-on knowledge with AWS core services like EC2, S3, VPC, IAM, Lambda and also infrastructure deployments using Terraform, set up CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, and I have also knowledge on containerization and orchestration tools Docker and Kubernetes.

I also enjoy coding with Python.

I'm a quick learner and passionate about automation and cloud technologies. 

I'm now looking forward to contributing to a company where I can grow as an AWS Engineer.




 

where do you see your self in five years?

In five years, I see myself as a Senior DevOps Engineer, primarily working on AWS-based cloud infrastructure. 
I plan to earn relevant certifications like the AWS Certified DevOps Engineer and keep upgrading my skills in 
areas like Kubernetes, CI/CD automation, and infrastructure as code using tools like Terraform. 
I also aim to contribute to architectural decisions and mentor junior team members, 
helping drive efficiency and innovation within the DevOps team



Route 53: Like your phone's contact list – it converts names to numbers (domain → IP).

Route Table: Like Google Maps for your VPC – tells traffic how to reach its destination.

API Gateway: Like the reception desk – takes user requests and forwards them to the correct backend (Lambda, EC2, etc.).
